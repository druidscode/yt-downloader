# yt-downloader.py

## about

it is more of my personal project but i thought there are people who probably don't have internet acess 24/7, they might need something like this.
it is basically a python script to download videos from youtube at high quality.

## usage

- you need to have python installed on your system.
- install pytube library using ```pip install pytube```.
- now you can run this python script using ```python yt-downloader.py```
- if you don't want the hassle of installing python, you can make this script executable using something like [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) or [py2exe](https://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial).

## update
- i've uploaded the executable file for this script, now you can run this script on your windows system without installing python and it's libraries. but i can't promise that the executable file is going to be fully updated, i still prefer the script method. enjoy.
